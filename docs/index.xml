      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Ruben Orrostieta, I&amp;rsquo;m a 29 year old looking to transition my career into something I really love.
I have a chemical engineer academic formation but my passion in the past couple years has been technology, because of this and how my professional career has been evolving I decided to enroll in a Master of Science on Data Science at Colorado University Boulder.
So far this has been quite a journey and hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll have more details to share with you.</description>
