# About Me

Hi! I'm Ruben Orrostieta, I'm a 29 year old looking to transition my career into something I really love.

I have a chemical engineer academic formation but my passion in the past couple years has been technology, because of this and how my professional career has been evolving I decided to enroll in a Master of Science on Data Science at Colorado University Boulder.

So far this has been quite a journey and hopefully I'll have more details to share with you.
